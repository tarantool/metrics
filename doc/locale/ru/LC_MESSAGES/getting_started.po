msgid "First, you need to install the ``metrics`` package:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Next, require it in your code:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Set a global label for your metrics:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enable default Tarantool metrics such as network, memory, operations, etc:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you use Cartridge, enable Cartridge metrics:"

msgid "Initialize the Prometheus Exporter, or export metrics in any other format:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you can use the HTTP API endpoint ``/metrics`` to collect your "
"metrics in the Prometheus format. If you need your custom metrics, see "
"the :ref:`API reference <metrics-api-reference>`."

"In production environments Tarantool Cluster usually has a large number "
"of so called \"routers\", Tarantool instances that handle input load and "
"it is required to evenly distribute the load. Various load-balancers are "
"used for this, but any load-balancer have to know which \"routers\" are "
"ready to accept the load at that very moment. Metrics library has a "
"special plugin that creates an http handler that can be used by the load-"
"balancer to check the current state of any Tarantool instance. If the "
"instance is ready to accept the load, it will return a response with a "
"200 status code, if not, with a 500 status code."

msgid "Cartridge role"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``cartridge.roles.metrics`` is a role for `Tarantool Cartridge "
"<https://github.com/tarantool/cartridge>`_. It allows using default "
"metrics in a Cartridge application and manage them via configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Usage**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add ``metrics`` package to dependencies in the ``.rockspec`` file. Make "
"sure that you are using version **0.3.0** or higher."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure that you have ``cartridge.roles.metrics`` in the roles list in "
"``cartridge.cfg`` in your entry-point file (e.g. ``init.lua``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "To view metrics via API endpoints, use ``set_export``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**NOTE** that ``set_export`` has lower priority than clusterwide config "
"and won't work if metrics config is present."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can add several entry points of the same format by different paths, "
"like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The metrics will be available on the path specified in ``path`` in the "
"format specified in ``format``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enable role in the interface:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since version **0.6.0** metrics role is permanent and enabled on "
"instances by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After role initialization, default metrics will be enabled and the global"
" label ``'alias'`` will be set. **Note** that ``'alias'`` label value is "
"set by instance :ref:`configuration option <cartridge-config>` ``alias`` "
"or ``instance_name`` (since **0.6.1**)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to use the functionality of any metrics package, you may get "
"it as a Cartridge service and use it like a regular package after "
"``require``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is an ability in Tarantool Cartridge >= ``'2.4.0'`` to set a zone "
"for each server in cluster. If zone was set for the server ``'zone'`` "
"label for all metrics of this server will be added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To change metrics HTTP path in **runtime**, you may use the following "
"configuration (to learn more about Cartridge configuration, see `this "
"<https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/cartridge/topics"
"/clusterwide-config/#managing-role-specific-data>`_). We don't recommend "
"to use it to set up metrics role, use ``set_export`` instead."
