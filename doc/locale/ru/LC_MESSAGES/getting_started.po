"In production environments Tarantool Cluster usually has a large number of "

"required to evenly distribute the load. Various load-balancers are used for "
"this, but any load-balancer have to know which \"routers\" are ready to "
"accept the load at that very moment. Metrics library has a special plugin "
"that creates an http handler that can be used by the load-balancer to check "
"the current state of any Tarantool instance. If the instance is ready to "
"accept the load, it will return a response with a 200 status code, if not, "

msgid "**Usage**"

msgid ""
"Add ``metrics`` package to dependencies in the ``.rockspec`` file. Make sure"

"**NOTE** that ``set_export`` has lower priority than clusterwide config and "

"To change metrics HTTP path in **runtime**, you may use the following "
