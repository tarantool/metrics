A targeted :math:`\\\\varphi`-quantile is specified in the form of a :math:`\\\\varphi`-quantile and tolerated error. For example a ``{[0.5] = 0.1}`` means that the median (= 50th percentile) should be returned with 10 percent error. Note that percentiles and quantiles are the same concept, except percentiles are expressed as percentages. The :math:`\\\\varphi`-quantile must be in the interval [0, 1]. Note that a lower tolerated error for a :math:`\\\\varphi`-quantile results in higher usage of resources (memory and cpu) to calculate the summary."
msgstr ""

msgid "Table of summary parameters, used for configuring sliding window of time. 'Sliding window' consists of several buckets to store observations. New observations are added to each bucket. After a time period, 'head' bucket (bucket from which observations are collected) is reset and next bucket becomes new 'head'. I.e. each bucket will store observations for ``max_age_time * age_buckets_count`` seconds before it will be reset. ``max_age_time`` sets the duration of each bucket lifetime, i.e., how long observations are kept before they are discarded, in seconds ``age_buckets_count`` sets the number of buckets of the time window. It determines the number of buckets used to exclude observations that are older than ``max_age_time`` from the Summary. The value is a trade-off between resources (memory and cpu for maintaining the bucket) and how smooth the time window is moved. Default value is `{max_age_time = math.huge, age_buckets_count = 1}`"

msgid "Labels"
msgstr ""

msgid "All collectors support providing ``label_pairs`` on data modification. Labels are basically a metainfo that you associate with a metric in the format of key-value pairs. See tags in Graphite and labels in Prometheus. Labels are used to differentiate the characteristics of a thing being measured. For example, in a metric associated with the total number of http requests, you can use methods and statuses label pairs:"
msgstr ""

msgid "You don't have to predefine labels in advance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using labels on your metrics allows you to later derive new time series (visualize their graphs) by specifying conditions on label values. In the example above, we could derive these time series:"

msgstr ""

msgid "Global labels can be changed on the fly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Observation ``label_pairs`` has priority over global labels: if you pass ``label_pairs`` to an observation method with the same key as some global label, the method argument value will be used."
